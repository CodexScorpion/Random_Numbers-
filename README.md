# Random_Numbers
The program has been implemented in Object-Oriented Programming style with a RationalNumber class that represents a rational number and includes methods for performing arithmetic operations, comparison, conversion to floating-point numbers, and finding the absolute value of the rational numbers.


## RationalNumber Class
The main class of the program is RationalNumberApp, which takes two rational numbers as input and performs various operations on them, and then displays the results on the console. The program also includes exception handling to handle bad inputs and prevent the program from crashing.

## Steps to run the program:

1. Clone the repository from the GitHub link provided.

2. Open the project in an IDE like Eclipse or IntelliJ.

3. Run the RationalNumberApp class.

4. Enter two rational numbers in the form of "a/b c/d" as command-line arguments when prompted by the console.

5. The program will perform various operations on the input rational numbers and display the results on the console.
